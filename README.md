# 🌎 VoyageVista  
A cinematic, scroll-driven travel experience showcasing five iconic Colombian cities.

VoyageVista is a high-end, full-screen travel catalog site built with **React**, **Vite**, and **TailwindCSS**.  
Each section uses vertical **scroll-snap**, cinematic background visuals, smooth transitions, and elegant typography to create an immersive travel experience.

Originally developed on Replit using AI-assisted workflows, VoyageVista is now fully migrated to GitHub for continued development with Code Assistants and local tooling.
